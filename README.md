Dutson shows how to design sites that are responsive “from the start,” while keeping development simple and flexible. Next, he delivers complete technical know-how for transforming responsive designs into responsive sites. You’ll find coverage of key issues such as integrating media content, optimizing performance, and serving Retina or high-density displays.

Dutson展示了如何“从一开始”就设计响应式网站，并且同时能保持开发的简易性和灵活性。其次，他提供了将响应设计转换为响应网站的成套技术。你将会发现这些技术覆盖了几乎所有关键问题，例如整合媒体内容、优化性能和为视网膜或高密度显示器服务等问题。

Throughout, he combines detailed and practical explanations with functional, easy-to-reuse code snippets. 

自始至终，他将所有功能都进行了详细而实用的解释说明，并且附上便于复用的代码片段。

Coverage includes

•    Demonstrating why “mobile first” is still a best practice
•    Fusing content, structure, and beauty to deliver experiences users love
•    Using responsive images to improve speed and convey visual messages more effectively
•    Using grid systems without making it feel like your design is “locked in a box”
•    Mastering measurement values such as px, em, rem, and viewport units—and understanding their crucial differences
•    Improving the finer details of your design with web fonts
•    Retrofitting current websites to prepare them for the future

This is a great book and a very timely topic. What Web developer hasn't been recently asked to make their sites and apps more "mobile friendly"? Phil Dutson explores the ins and outs of making our designs work at every conceivable resolution and orientation, and he does so concisely even while staying very readable.

Part 1 is all about layout. He makes sure you understand what content is and why it's important to distinguish it from site mechanics and UI. He follows this up with a strong case for "mobile first" design, then tackles everything you need to know to make such a layout happen, including grids, tables, and typography. The in-depth explanations of CSS's relative measurement values and media queries were something I appreciated especially, and I've already made use of my new-found expertise to greatly improve the responsiveness and usability of my own designs.

Part 2 covers responsive media concerns. Ever wondered how to deliver images or video at the appropriate resolution for a target device? It's all here. The section closes up with a comprehensive look at image compression, including when to use different image types and utilities (many of them free) that you can acquire to convert and compress images. This is typical of Phil's approach throughout the book: he presents just enough theory to give you the bird's-eye view, then he details the practical steps that you can use to get the job done quickly and easily.

Part 3 is all about performance. Here, the author explores ways you can customize the user experience in key ways for each target platform. Also covered are some of the more futuristic, emerging standards, such as web components for ultimate ease-of-development and code reusability. Techniques for device detection, optimizing delivery from the server side, and getting the most out of your development tools close out the section.

As a veteran of hundreds of technical texts, I also appreciate that the book has been delivered with a high level of professionalism. The language is clear, mistakes minimal-to-nonexistent, and the layout is clean. I highly recommend adding this tome to your collection if you want to deliver your content to as many devices (and people) as possible.

When it comes to writing about food, some books marketed as cookbooks and really just catalogs of recipes, and other books are about food but have lots of recipes as well. Responsive Mobile Design, by Phil Dutson, is a cookbook of the second sort, about responsive mobile design that has lots of recipes.

I never really did get the cookbook format for computer books; the few I’ve bought I’ve inevitably answer a few questions, but I never really read them cover to cover. Phil Dutson’s book is different — not only are there lots of clear examples and how-you-should-go-about-doing-this kinds of things, but there’s lots of information about responsive design, and modern design for the web in general. As such, it worked really well — Dutson introduces a topic, talks about it in very specific terms, and then looks at specific points that require closer attention with technical examples or pointers to frameworks. There are lots of examples, and lots of figures showing the output of the examples, so you can really see what he’s talking about.

The book begins with some general observations about web design and content, which though lightweight technically, are a welcome reminder that it’s all too possible to create a technically excellent site that wouldn’t interest anyone. From there, he moves on to discussing basic layout principles with grids, tables, and measurement, before getting into the details of media queries and typography. There’s a whole section (three chapters) on how to make multimedia responsive, and then five more chapters on the specifics of tuning the performance of mobile web site, looking at everything from server choices to optimizing JavaScript and measuring performance with modern browsers. Dutson provides a clear, engaging style throughout; I planned on pacing myself by reading a couple of chapters a night to let things sink in, and frequently moved on to a third or even fourth chapter before stopping.

I got a lot more out of the book than I expected, and I had pretty high hopes to begin with. If I had to name a fault of the book, it’s that I’m not sure how well it will age in some regards. Dutson is very good about discussing proposed standards and differences between browsers, which should hold up well. However, he often provides pointers to frameworks, and it’s not clear how many of these frameworks will be around or kept relevant in the two-to-four year lifespan of a printed book. On the other hand, having those pointers and a summary of what’s available is great — if you’re just getting started setting up a site, it’s nice to know the pros and cons of the various packages you can start with. So I think his decision was the right one, and it may mean a little more time with Bing or Google once the book’s been out for a while.

If you’re at all curious about what makes a modern web site tick, or if you’re presently engaged in working on responsive sites, this is definitely a book to have.
