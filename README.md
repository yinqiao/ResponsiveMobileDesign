数十亿的用户通过智能手机、平板电脑以及其它类型设备连接到互联网，并通过各种接口和显示器将信息展示出来。但是，所有的用户的目标都是一致的：及时、准确的信息以最美的方式发送出来。通过使用**响应式移动设计**可以给予用户他们所想要的内容。

Whether you’re a developer, designer, or manager, Phil Dutson teaches you principles, techniques, and best practices for delivering a successful experience to all users on all devices.

不论你是开发者、设计师，还是管理者，Phil Dutson 都可教你如何在所有设备上给予用户一个成功的体验的原则、技巧以及最佳实践。

Dutson shows how to design sites that are responsive “from the start,” while keeping development simple and flexible. Next, he delivers complete technical know-how for transforming responsive designs into responsive sites. You’ll find coverage of key issues such as integrating media content, optimizing performance, and serving Retina or high-density displays.

Dutson展示了如何“从一开始”就设计响应式网站，并且同时能保持开发的简易性和灵活性。其次，他提供了将响应设计转换为响应网站的成套技术。你将会发现这些技术覆盖了几乎所有关键问题，例如整合媒体内容、优化性能和为视网膜或高密度显示器服务等问题。

Throughout, he combines detailed and practical explanations with functional, easy-to-reuse code snippets. 

自始至终，他将所有功能都进行了详细而实用的解释说明，并且附上便于复用的代码片段。

Coverage includes

•    Demonstrating why “mobile first” is still a best practice
•    Fusing content, structure, and beauty to deliver experiences users love
•    Using responsive images to improve speed and convey visual messages more effectively
•    Using grid systems without making it feel like your design is “locked in a box”
•    Mastering measurement values such as px, em, rem, and viewport units—and understanding their crucial differences
•    Improving the finer details of your design with web fonts
•    Retrofitting current websites to prepare them for the future
•    Introducing web components into your HTML markup
•    Using built-in browser development tools to streamline debugging and “in-browser” prototyping

主要内容包括：

- 论述了为什么“手机第一”仍然是最佳实践
- 融合内容、结构和美丽来传递用户喜欢的经历
- 使用响应式图像来提高响应速度并能够更有效地传达视觉信息
- 使用网格系统避免让用户觉得你的设计是“锁在一个盒子里”
- 掌握测量值例如px、em、rem以及视口单位等，并了解它们之间至关重要的差异
- 使用web字体提高设计的细节
- 改造现有网站为未来做好准备
- 为web组件引入HTML标记
- 使用内置的浏览器开发工具来简化调试和“浏览器”的原型

This is a great book and a very timely topic. Why Web developer hasn't been recently asked to make their sites and apps more "mobile friendly"? Phil Dutson explores the ins and outs of making our designs work at every conceivable resolution and orientation, and he does so concisely even while staying very readable.

这是一本好书，响应式是一个时下非常时髦的话题。为什么最近Web开发人员没有要求让他们的网站和应用程序更加“移动端友好化”？Phil Dutson探索了如何使我们的设计工作在每一个可以想象的分辨率和定位的来龙去脉，虽然他的做法简明扼要，但是扔保持很强的可读性。

Part 1 is all about layout. He makes sure you understand what content is and why it's important to distinguish it from site mechanics and UI. He follows this up with a strong case for "mobile first" design, then tackles everything you need to know to make such a layout happen, including grids, tables, and typography. 

The in-depth explanations of CSS's relative measurement values and media queries were something I appreciated especially, and I've already made use of my new-found expertise to greatly improve the responsiveness and usability of my own designs.

第1部分是关于布局。Phil Dutson确保你理解内容是什么，以及将内容与网站力学和UI区别开来非常重要。接着举了一个强大的“手机第一”的设计案例，然后解决所有你需要了解的这种布局中的重要概念，包括网格、表和排版。
我特别欣赏有深入解释的CSS的相关的测量值、媒体查询的部分内容，我已经用这些新技术大大提高了我自己的设计的响应性和可用性。

Part 2 covers responsive media concerns. Ever wondered how to deliver images or video at the appropriate resolution for a target device? It's all here. The section closes up with a comprehensive look at image compression, including when to use different image types and utilities (many of them free) that you can acquire to convert and compress images. This is typical of Phil's approach throughout the book: he presents just enough theory to give you the bird's-eye view, then he details the practical steps that you can use to get the job done quickly and easily.

第2部分介绍响应式媒体查询相关内容。你有想过如何提供适当分辨率的图像或视频给目标设备吗？这里有所以的技巧和方法。这节内容介绍了全面的图像压缩方法，包括何时使用不同的图像类型和实用程序（其中许多是免费的），你可以用于转换和压缩图像。这是Phil贯穿本书的典型方法：他提出了足够的理论给你整体概念，然后他详细描述了实际的步骤，你可以使用它来快速轻松地完成工作。

Part 3 is all about performance. Here, the author explores ways you can customize the user experience in key ways for each target platform. Also covered are some of the more futuristic, emerging standards, such as web components for ultimate ease-of-development and code reusability. Techniques for device detection, optimizing delivery from the server side, and getting the most out of your development tools close out the section.

第三部分是关于性能。在这部分，作者探索了为每个目标平台在关键方面定制用户体验。还介绍了一些未来、新兴的标准，例如web组件最终易于开发和代码的可重用性。本节最后介绍了技术设备检测、优化从服务器端交付，并优化你的开发工具。

As a veteran of hundreds of technical texts, I also appreciate that the book has been delivered with a high level of professionalism. The language is clear, mistakes minimal-to-nonexistent, and the layout is clean. I highly recommend adding this tome to your collection if you want to deliver your content to as many devices (and people) as possible.

作为一名阅读了数百本技术文本、经验丰富的人，我也欣赏这本书发表了高水平的职业精神。本书语言清晰，错误极少甚至没有，布局干净整洁。如果你想将你的内容尽可能多的设备(和人)，我强烈推荐将本册书加入你的收藏夹。

When it comes to writing about food, some books marketed as cookbooks and really just catalogs of recipes, and other books are about food but have lots of recipes as well. Responsive Mobile Design, by Phil Dutson, is a cookbook of the second sort, about responsive mobile design that has lots of recipes.

I never really did get the cookbook format for computer books; the few I’ve bought I’ve inevitably answer a few questions, but I never really read them cover to cover. Phil Dutson’s book is different — not only are there lots of clear examples and how-you-should-go-about-doing-this kinds of things, but there’s lots of information about responsive design, and modern design for the web in general. As such, it worked really well — Dutson introduces a topic, talks about it in very specific terms, and then looks at specific points that require closer attention with technical examples or pointers to frameworks. There are lots of examples, and lots of figures showing the output of the examples, so you can really see what he’s talking about.

The book begins with some general observations about web design and content, which though lightweight technically, are a welcome reminder that it’s all too possible to create a technically excellent site that wouldn’t interest anyone. From there, he moves on to discussing basic layout principles with grids, tables, and measurement, before getting into the details of media queries and typography. There’s a whole section (three chapters) on how to make multimedia responsive, and then five more chapters on the specifics of tuning the performance of mobile web site, looking at everything from server choices to optimizing JavaScript and measuring performance with modern browsers. Dutson provides a clear, engaging style throughout; I planned on pacing myself by reading a couple of chapters a night to let things sink in, and frequently moved on to a third or even fourth chapter before stopping.

I got a lot more out of the book than I expected, and I had pretty high hopes to begin with. If I had to name a fault of the book, it’s that I’m not sure how well it will age in some regards. Dutson is very good about discussing proposed standards and differences between browsers, which should hold up well. However, he often provides pointers to frameworks, and it’s not clear how many of these frameworks will be around or kept relevant in the two-to-four year lifespan of a printed book. On the other hand, having those pointers and a summary of what’s available is great — if you’re just getting started setting up a site, it’s nice to know the pros and cons of the various packages you can start with. So I think his decision was the right one, and it may mean a little more time with Bing or Google once the book’s been out for a while.

If you’re at all curious about what makes a modern web site tick, or if you’re presently engaged in working on responsive sites, this is definitely a book to have.
